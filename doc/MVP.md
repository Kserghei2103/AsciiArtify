# Minimum Viable Product (MVP)

Goal: Create a minimally functional product that can be brought to market and receive feedback from users. In our case, this is a demonstration of the AsciiArtify application

Let's create an application using a graphical interface. The application in ArgoCD will monitor the Git repository of the product https://github.com/Kserghei2103/go-demo-app and configure automatic synchronization.

We check the operation of the application.
